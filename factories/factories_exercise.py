"""
    You are given a class called Person . The person has two attributes: id , and name .

    Please implement a  PersonFactory that has a non-static  create_person() method that takes a person's name and return a person initialized with this name and an id.

    The id of the person should be set as a 0-based index of the object created. So, the first person the factory makes should have Id=0, second Id=1 and so on.
